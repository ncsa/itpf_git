## Basic Git

Topics and commands you should be familiar with before starting this lesson:

- Initializing a repository (`git init`)
- Repository locations
    * Repository (`.git` directory)
    * Working directory
    * Staging area / index / cache (`.git/index` file)
- Recording changes
    * Adding changes to the cache (`git add`)
    * Recording changes in the repository (`git commit`)
- Exploring the history of changes (`git log`)
- Identifying changes
    - changes that have not been "staged" yet (`git diff`)
    - changes that have been "staged" already (`git diff --staged`)
- Ignoring files and directories in the repository (`.gitignore`)
